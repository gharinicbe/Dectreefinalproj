Decision Tree Classification for Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset
Introduction
This project aims to use Decision Tree Classification to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women based on certain diagnostic measures. The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Attribute Selection Measures
Before building the Decision Tree Classifier, attribute selection measures are used to determine the most important features of the dataset. The following measures are used:

Entropy
Max_depth
Building and Optimizing Decision Tree Classifier
The Decision Tree Classifier is built and optimized using the Python Scikit-learn package. The following steps are taken:

Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Build the Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn
Use Cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the model
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
How to Use the Code
The code for this project is available in the diabetes_decision_tree.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file. To run the code, the following steps should be taken:

Install Jupyter Notebook and the required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the diabetes_decision_tree.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells.
Conclusion
The Decision Tree Classification algorithm is a powerful tool for predicting the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women. By using attribute selection measures and optimizing the hyperparameters of the model, we can achieve high accuracy in our predictions.
